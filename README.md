### HTML and CSS part
I got to learn;
    1.Website responsivity
    2. Essential HTML concepts
    3. Essential CSS concepts

I experienced challenges such as :

    1. I had issues with dividing my divs I ended up making unnecessary div tags and unnecessary classes and ids
    2. Still didn't have experiences with other html elements concepts
    3. Had css issues with padding and alignment of the elements (box model issues)
    4. It was pretty challenging when I had to include responsiveness to the website
    5. Alot of delay in image loading.

Nevertheless, the experience was very engaging and proved to be an **eye-opener** towards my journey of web development.

### Deploying it on a open source deploying website (On Vercel) [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

I got to learn about deployng my website on Vercel. I chose vercel because it was easy to use it and it was user friendly. Ofcourse there were other websites like Netlify etc but this website stood out  the most.
Some of the challenges occured were:
    1. Directory arrangement where I had to arrange my files well so that the main page could be seen.
    2. 

### Serving it with Nginx (both HTTP and HTTPS)
I got to learn about hosting my website on Nginx which proved to be an educative challenge and further brought to my exposure towards backend programming.
I got to learn about;
    1. Static website hosting
    2. Directory arrangement
